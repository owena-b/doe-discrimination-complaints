# Discrimination complaints filed with the U.S. Department of Education

[Python code](scrape.py) to scrape [a data table](https://ocrcas.ed.gov/open-investigations) containing a list of federal discrimination complaints filed against institutions of post-secondary education.

The program formats the data into a CSV in which each line is one complaint against one school. The code also replaces state and territory abbreviations with their full names.
